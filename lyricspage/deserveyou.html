    <h1>SONG - Altered Lyrics</h1>
    <p>

	I know you've been alone, waitin' on me
Thinkin' 'bout things that's only gon' hurt you
And I know sometimes it was hard to see my love
And you thought that I stopped tryin'

I'm lost in my head, many miles away
Feelin' the distance, sayin' “Girl, beware”
Guess I pushed you away when you needed me there
Thought I could hold on, thought I was prepared, No
All these hoes, no one that compares though
Who the fuck told I stopped tryin'? Woah
Um, hit the bars, matchin' what they wear
Nothin' hits right when I'm missin' you around
And ain't nobody fuckin' with you here
And that's for sure
You got competition, it's not even fair
No, I don't care you have to say
I text you I'll be there, but until then, oh

I know you've been alone, waitin' on me
Thinkin' 'bout things that's only gon' hurt you
And I know sometimes it was hard to see my love
And you thought that I stopped tryin'
Nobody, nobody else
Nobody, nobody else
Nobody, no, I don't deserve you (no, no)
Nobody, nobody else
Nobody, nobody else
Nobody, no, I don't deserve you
I don't deserve you


I wrote this song at the start of the month
Back then when you were still here with me
It's not the way you feel that hurts
It's that you couldn't be real with me
I spent gave you patience and all my time,
How could you not feel for me?
But that's the reason I was so confused 'cause you said
"I wanna drop the label, no option to work through"
You made up your mind now, I know that you're hurt too
I hope that he loves you the way like I wanted to
The way that I could have, all that I needed
Was for you to have patience with me
Don't fake it with me
Was it so blatant to see that
That I was never enough for you
You were complacent with me
There was a space that you needed to fill
Guess I was never enough for you
