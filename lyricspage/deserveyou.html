    <h1>SONG - Altered Lyrics</h1>
    <p>
	
	
	
	<br>
	
I know you've been alone, waitin' on me<br>
Thinkin' 'bout things that's only gon' hurt you<br>
And I know sometimes it was hard to see my love<br>
And you thought that I stopped tryin'<br>
<br>
I'm lost in my head, many miles away<br>
Feelin' the distance, sayin' “Girl, beware”<br>
Guess I pushed you away when you needed me there<br>
Thought I could hold on, thought I was prepared, No<br>
All these hoes, no one that compares though<br>
Who the fuck told I stopped tryin'? Woah<br>
Um, hit the bars, matchin' what they wear<br>
Nothin' hits right when I'm missin' you around<br>
And ain't nobody fuckin' with you here<br>
And that's for sure<br>
You got competition, it's not even fair<br>
No, I don't care you have to say<br>
I text you I'll be there, but until then, oh<br>
<br>
I know you've been alone, waitin' on me<br>
Thinkin' 'bout things that's only gon' hurt you<br>
And I know sometimes it was hard to see my love<br>
And you thought that I stopped tryin'<br>
<br>
Nobody, nobody else<br>
Nobody, nobody else<br>
Nobody, no, I don't deserve you (no, no)<br>
Nobody, nobody else<br>
Nobody, nobody else<br>
Nobody, no, I wasn't enough for you<br>
I was never enough for you<br>
<br>

I wrote this song at the start of the month<br>
Back then when you were still here with me<br>
It's not the way you feel that hurts<br>
It's that you couldn't be real with me<br>
I spent gave you patience and all my time,<br>
How could you not feel for me?<br>
But that's the reason I was so confused 'cause you said<br>
"I wanna drop the label, no option to work through"<br>
You made up your mind now, I know that you're hurt too<br>
I hope that he loves you the way like I wanted to<br>
The way that I could have, all that I needed<br>
Was for you to have patience with me<br>
Don't fake it with me<br>
Was it so blatant to see that<br>
That I was never enough for you<br>
You were complacent with me<br>
There was a space that you needed to fill<br>
Guess I was never enough for you<br>
