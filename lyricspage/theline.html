    <h1>THE LINE - Altered Lyrics</h1>
    <p>
	

        You've done things that I don't like<br>
        But you crossed the line this time<br>
        Don't say sorry, don't apologize<br>
        'Cause you crossed the line this time<br>
        <br>
        Yeah, after three months, I'm just another one<br>
        You found somebody else, another one<br>
        But I miss you around, yeah, I can't lie<br>
        Mom still brings you up, she wonders why<br>
        I heard all the whispers on the street<br>
        It contradicts the things you said to me<br>
        You're convinced that you know how to please<br>
        And I don't know how I'm supposed to leave<br>
        You said that you got love for me still, did you mean it?<br>
        I think about it when it's quiet, tryna make sense of how I feel<br>
        You talked to me like I was just a phase, had your fun<br>
        But this time it's different â€” I'm done<br>
        <br>
        You've done things that I don't like<br>
        But you crossed the line this time<br>
        Don't say sorry, don't apologize<br>
        'Cause you crossed the line this time<br>
        <br>
        Tell me, how did you run so fast?<br>
        Leaving what we built in the past<br>
        There's no saving this, no way back<br>
        You chose what you did, kept me off track<br>
        Die for me, I die for you<br>
        I fall to pieces every time I think about movin' on, I can't<br>
        Wash this blood up off my hands, I<br>
        
        <br>
        I've done things you can't comprehend
        'Cause we fell apart
        Oh, we fell apart
        <br>
        You've done things that I don't like <br>
        But you crossed the line this time<br>
        Don't say sorry, don't apologize<br>
        'Cause you crossed the line this time<br>
        <br>
        I know you're in a strange place now<br>
        Things have changed, yeah, somehow<br>
        But I need to say this for me<br>
        So I can finally feel free<br>
