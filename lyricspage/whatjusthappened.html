    <h1>WHAT JUST HAPPENED - Altered Lyrics</h1>
    <p>
	
        I don't know if we just crossed the line<br>
        'Cause I don't even know what just happened<br>
        Everything I said last night was just to buy time<br>
        But even now, I don't even know what happened<br>
        <br>
        Thoughts blurred, feelings faded, no way out<br>
        Then you walked in, made me question it all<br>
        I said some things about you and us<br>
        I said things 'bout us I can't take back now<br>
        Yeah, we both know you don't give a fuck<br>
        Wanna be friends, and you wanna fuck<br>
        What's your excuse? I'ma blame the alcohol<br>
        I care, I care, I don't care enough<br>
        <br>
        Stop it, but you won't, won't, won't<br>
        We loved it, but it's cold, cold<br>
        Yeah, you don't like bein' 'lone, lonely<br>
        You knew what you were doing, you were dead wrong<br>
        <br>
        I don't know if we just crossed the line<br>
        'Cause I don't even know what just happened<br>
        Everything I said last night was just to buy time<br>
        But even now, I don't even know what happened<br>
        <br>
        
        Lost in a dark place, stuck here wonderin' what went wrong<br>
        Thought I could reach out, but now you're long gone<br>
        Uh, all I remember is feelin' the distance<br>
        Then I woke up in my bed replaying our silence<br>
        Tell me it was just talk, nothin' more in the end<br>
        I got missed calls, if you rang, I ignored it<br>
        Told myself I did everything I could do<br>
        Guess I'm the only one who'll know the truth<br>
        <br>
        Stop it, but you won't, won't, won't<br>
        We loved it, but it's cold, cold<br>
        Yeah, you don't like bein' 'lone, lonely<br>
        You knew what you were doing, you were dead wrong<br>
        <br>
        I don't know if we just crossed the line<br>
        'Cause I don't even know what just happened<br>
        Everything I said last night was just to buy time<br>
        But even now, I don't even know what happened<br>
        <br>
