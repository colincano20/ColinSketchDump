Don't let it go to your head<br>
Things that they said<br>
They made their bed <br>
I gave you reasons, but you chose him instead<br>
Tears wouldn't shed<br>
I know you're scared<br>

<br>
Um<br>
How's everyone know what's best for you<br>
When I'm right here next to you?<br>
You said that you get it, but it wasn't enough<br>
You said you'd try, but you gave it up
So now I'm torn between<br>
Forgivin' the past and lettin' it be<br>
Makin' amends or finally leavin'<br>
Lockin' my heart or keepin' it open<br>
No, these decisions don't get easy<br>
I told you I'd always be there for you<br>
But now I'm prayin' for some kind of miracle, 'cause<br>
The taste of our love turned sour, sour, sour, uh<br>
Don't trip, I'll move on soon<br>
The past's gone, but it still feels so new<br>

<br>
Don't let it go to your head<br>
Things that they said<br>
They made their bed <br>
I gave you reasons, but you chose him instead<br>
Tears wouldn't shed<br>
I know you're scared<br>
<br>
T-R-U-S-T, I gave it to you<br>
And look at the cracks it put me through<br>
I gave you my heart, but what did you do?<br>
Took it for granted, then split it in two, uh<br>
I saw you change when you weren't with me<br>
Your words said one thing, your actions made me see<br>
Ooh, they want your side, but I know your truth<br>
Ooh, I act a fool, yeah, I won't chase you<br>
I let go of what we built, piece by piece<br>
You'll tell them it's all me<br>
But I know that's your defense, just let it be<br>
<br>
Don't let it go to your head<br>
Things that they said<br>
They made their bed <br>
I gave you reasons, but you chose him instead<br>
Tears wouldn't shed<br>
I know you're scared<br>
<br>
We're both hanging on with one hand<br>
But I had to let go at last<br>
II looked in the mirror and saw all the fear in my eyes<br>
That's the first time I felt alive without the lies<br>
