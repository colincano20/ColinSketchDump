    <h1>TOO MUCH - Altered Lyrics</h1>
    <p>
	
	    Uh, if we had the chance and the time to spend<br>
		Would you do it again? Would you do it again?<br>
		Was it too much? Uh, yeah<br>
		Was it too much? Ayy, uh<br>
		Now you're callin' your friends 'cause I'm gone again<br>
		When I'm back around, would you do it again?<br>
		Was it too much? Uh, ayy<br>
		<br>

		So tell me what got in the way<br>
		And how I thought it was good that it changed<br>
		And I'm sayin' I'm sorry again<br>
		Oh, I could never get out of my way<br>
		Say you're busy and I never complained<br>
		And still all that you do is complain<br>
		You keep on telling me that I changed<br>
		And now you're tellin' me I need some space<br>
		<br>
		So I'm layin' in my bed, drunk as fuck now<br>
		I'll be dead before I'm without you now<br>
		Realizin' I'm addicted to you now<br>
		Come right here, baby, relax and cool down<br>
		What you sayin'? Hit me back with the move now <br>
		In my brain, no one else, it's just you now<br>
		Let me love you the way that I do now<br>
		I never knew how<br>
		<br>

		Uh, if we had the chance and the time to spend<br>
		Would you do it again? Would you do it again?<br>
		Was it too much? Uh, yeah<br>
		Was it too much? Ayy, uh<br>
		Now you're callin' your friends 'cause I'm gone again<br>
		When I'm back around, would you do it again?<br>
		Was it too much? Uh, ayy<br>
		<br>

		Am I asking for too much?<br>
		Do you understand my jokes and get my sense of humor?<br>
		When your girlfriends question if I'm really around<br>
		Would you believe me if I told you that they lyin' and I'm not playin'?<br>
		Wish I could send a car, but I know it's on you to be here <br>
		You know it's serious when you came over and I gave you my sweatshirt<br>
		Extra hoodies for your bag and some candies<br>
		You know I'm hardly on my own 'cause I'm tryna be present'<br>
		She call me king, she got issues, I am not her father<br>
		Hop off the boat, into the jet, leave the yacht at the harbor<br>
		Sometimes you'd call me for comfort, I'd be there, not a burden<br>
		Now I'm left wondering if I misread each word then<br>
		Kept my patience 'cause I thought we'd make this work out <br>
		Packed my hopes for the next time, only to get let down<br>
		<br>

		Uh, it's that time, pour it up, tryna clear my head<br>
		Thinking 'bout the calls where we talked until nothing was left<br>
		Back and forth, and you mad about things I never meant<br>
		Double text, no reply, but I'm knowin' that you read it<br>
		What's the plan? Can we work this thing through now?<br>
		In my brain, no one else, it's just you now (Yeah)<br>
		Let me love you the way that I do now<br>
		I never knew how<br>
