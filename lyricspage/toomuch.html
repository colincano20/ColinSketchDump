    <h1>SONG - Altered Lyrics</h1>
    <p>
	
	    Uh, if we had the chance and the time to spend
		Would you do it again? Would you do it again?
		Was it too much? Uh, yeah
		Was it too much? Ayy, uh
		Now you're callin' your friends 'cause I'm gone again
		When I'm back around, would you do it again?
		Was it too much? Uh, ayy
		

		So tell me what got in the way
		And how I thought it was good that it changed
		And I'm sayin' I'm sorry again
		Oh, I could never get out of my way
		Say you're busy and I never complained
		And still all that you do is complain
		You keep on telling me that I changed
		And now you're tellin' me I need some space

		So I'm layin' in my bed, drunk off some Titos
		I'll be dead before I'm without you now
		Realizin' I'm addicted to you now
		Come right here, baby, relax and cool down
		What you sayin'? Hit me back with the move now 
		In my brain, no one else, it's just you now
		Let me love you the way that I do now
		I never knew how
		
		Uh, if we had the chance and the time to spend
		Would you do it again? Would you do it again?
		Was it too much? Uh, yeah
		Was it too much? Ayy, uh
		Now you're callin' your friends 'cause I'm gone again
		When I'm back around, would you do it again?
		Was it too much? Uh, ayy

		[Verse 2: Central Cee & The Kid LAROI]
		Am I doin' too much?
		Do you understand my slang and get my sense of humor?
		When your girlfriends tell you I been fuckin' 'round
		Would you believe me if I told you that they lyin' and that's just a rumor?
		Send you my personal driver, man, this ain't just a Uber
		You know it's serious when you stay at mine and bring your toothbrush
		Extra panties in your bag and some makeup removers
		You know I'm hardly on my own 'cause I stay with a shooter
		She call me daddy, she got issues, I am not her father
		Hop off the boat, into the jet, leave the yacht at the harbor
		She injectin' with Ozempic, tryna stop her hunger
		Huh, I wanked before you came so I can fuck you longer
		S650, chauffeur driven, just tap your address in
		Pack your bags and we can board the next flight, we can check in
		Make sure you check that you ain't forgot your anti-depressants
		Before I fly you out again and you make me regret it (Ooh)
		[Pre-Chorus: The Kid LAROI & Jung Kook]
		Uh, it's that time, pour it up, let's take one into the head
		Top down, almost crashed 'cause I'm lookin' at your texts
		Back and forth, and you mad about shit I never said
		Double text, no reply, but I'm knowin' that you read it
		What you sayin'? Hit me back with the move now (Ooh)
		In my brain, no one else, it's just you now (Yeah)
		Let me love you the way that I do now
		I never knew how

		[Chorus: Jung Kook & The Kid LAROI]
		If we had the chance and the time to spend
		Would you do it again? Would you do it again?
		Was it too much? Uh, yeah (Too much, ooh)
		Was it too much? Ayy, uh (Too much)
		Now you're callin' your friends 'cause I'm gone again
		When I'm back around, would you do it again? (Would you do it again?)
		Was it too much? Uh, ayy (Too much)
		Was it too much? Uh, ayy (Tell me, was it too much?)
