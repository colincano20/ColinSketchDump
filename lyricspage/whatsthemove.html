    What's the move? (Uh-huh), tell me what it is<br>
    Pull up to your dorm, these thoughts feel heavy, tryna keep it in<br>
    We were close, like we were twins, but now I'm outside, can't get in<br>
    Your silence's as cold as my wrist, no rewindin' back, it's all split<br>
    I'm doin' the most, memories off the coast<br>
    Sitting here alone with these thoughts, no one to console<br>
    But actually, you were the one for me, wish you didn't let go<br>
    Fading pictures in my phone, smokin' thoughts while I'm on my own<br>

    <br>
Tell me just one more time<br>
Did it mean something to you?<br>
I'm sick of wastin' time<br>
And second-guessin' you<br>
I need some peace of mind<br>
I wanna leave the past behind<br>
But it's harder every time<br>
<br>
2 AM, I'm still awake, tryna piece what broke my faith<br>
Stressin' out, heart on replay, that's the type of pain I'm chained to<br>
I care less now, but it's hard to forget what we'd been through<br>
Double texts left unread<br>
I keep askin' what I could've done instead<br>
<br>
Tell me just one more time<br>
Did it mean something to you?<br>
I'm sick of wastin' time<br>
And second-guessin' you<br>
I need some peace of mind<br>
I wanna leave the past behind<br>
But it's harder every time<br>
