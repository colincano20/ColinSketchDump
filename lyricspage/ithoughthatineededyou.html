    <h1>I THOUGHT THAT I NEED YOU - Altered Lyrics</h1>
    <p>
	

		Ayy, we lost our love back in September<br>
		One month went on of us still together<br>
		I thought that I needed you<br>
		I thought that I needed—<br>
		You're not the one I thought you was<br>
		And it took so long to realize because<br>
		I thought that I needed you<br>
		I thought that I needed you<br>
<br>
		So fuck love again, girl, I'm through<br>
		You broke trust and I'm feelin' used<br>
		You promised I wouldn't feel this way again<br>
		Now I'm over here, I'm over here and all I feel is hate<br>
		I got a couple more things I wanna say, but I can't heal and<br>
		I tried everything that you could think to keep you herе, I<br>
		Ran over everything that you had said<br>
		But I don't carе what you say 'cause I'm over all that shit a while<br>
		And don't say sorry, it's too late to apologize<br>
		But you're not sorry, no, your face says it all<br>
		And I was there oh, I was there at your lowest times<br>
		We acted like it was great, but<br>
<br>
		We lost our love back in September<br>
		One month went on of us still together<br>
		I thought that I needed you<br>
		I thought that I needed—<br>
		You're not the one I thought you was<br>
		And it took so long to realize because<br>
		I thought that I needed you<br>
	<br>	
        And I sat here for days like how could you kiss him?<br>
		Oh, after everything, oh, how could you regret it?<br>
		I regret I ever thought you were the best thing<br>
		To happen in my life, guess in a way, this shit's a blessing<br>
		'Cause you thought that I needed you, and I thought I would need to<br>
		Despite what they had told me, I saw other things in you<br>
		The way we left it off was just not what we had agreed to<br>
		Thinkin' back on everything, I'm tryna figure out just how<br>

		<br>
		We lost our love back in September<br>
		One month went on of us still together<br>
		I thought that I needed you<br>
		I thought that I needed—<br>
		You're not the one I thought you was<br>
		And it took so long to realize because<br>
		I thought that I needed you<br>
		<br>
		Sit back, watch you leave, girl<br>
		We no longer speak, yeah<br>
		With him and not me, yeah<br>
		Feel lost and betrayed now<br>
		As you made your way out<br>
		Don't know what to say<br>
