    <h1>NIGHTS LIKE THIS - Altered Lyrics</h1>
    <p>
	
	
	
        Hold my hand, even if it's broken, fractured<br>
        Love me 'til the memories don't matter<br>
        I got all these feelings that I'm maskin'<br>
        Can I lay it on you? That's what I'm askin'<br>
        Late calls, laughter in the car, those small moments<br>
        Thought we had it allâ€”now I'm the one who's frozen<br>
        I still think of you and no one else<br>
        So if you would just come over, I could show you for myself<br>
        <br>
        And it's nights like this when I miss your touch<br>
        When I need someone that'll heal my soul<br>
        It's nights like this<br>
        Nights like, nights like this, ooh, ooh<br>
