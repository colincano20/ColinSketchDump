    <h1>TEAR ME APART - Altered Lyrics</h1>
    <p>
	
        I'm sorry for the pain I've caused<br>
        Sorry, it's just all my flaws<br>
        I'll go now<br>
        So we'll be fine in the next life and beyond<br>
        I don't wanna hurt you more<br>
        I'm drunk as hell, and my heart is torn<br>
        'Cause I don't know if I can wait for the next life<br>
        
        <br>
        So cut me off, I hang by a thread<br>
        'Cause when one thought's gone, it's replaced by the next<br>
        Got one foot up, but I'm so scared, oh, I, I, I'mâ€”<br>
        It's a pointless debate, but who's to blame?<br>
        We distract ourselves, but my feelings changed<br>
        And that old flame that we once had faded out<br>
        
        <br>
        I'm sorry for the pain I've caused<br>
        Sorry for the problems I've brought<br>
        I know that it's not your fault<br>
        But it's tearin' me up, these feelings I caught<br>
        Sharp aches, cryin' into space<br>
        A year's worth emotions in days<br>
        Why does everyone feel so strange?<br>
        Why do I feel like I'm the only one who's changed?<br>
       
        <br>
        So cut me off, I hang by a thread<br>
        'Cause when one thought's gone, it's replaced by the next<br>
        Got one foot off, but I'm so scared, oh, I, I, I'm<br>
        It's a pointless debate, but who's to blame?<br>
        We distract ourselves, but my feelings changed<br>
        And that old flame that we once had faded out<br>
        
        <br>
        So I'm, I'm never gonna look back, uh, uh<br>
        Never gonna look back, so<br>
        I'm never gonna do it to you again (Ah, ah, ah, ah)<br>
        Never gonna look back, never gonna regret<br>
        'Cause I'm never gonna look back<br>
        I'm tired of feelin' like I should hate myself<br>
        Left my body and took my soul<br>
        But when it's gone, where does it go?<br>
