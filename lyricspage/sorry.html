    <h1>SORRY - Altered Lyrics</h1>
    <p>
	 Woke up with the sun today, it's just another day<br>
     Passed by familiar places, new life, miles away.<br>
	 Feels like I've come far, got my own place now, some might say<br>
	 But every day, I wake up wishing you hadn't slipped away<br>
	 Can't turn back, can't rewind, tryin' to find peace in the pace<br>
	 No one warned me how much I'd have to give up to keep the space<br>
	 I'm just tryin' not to go insane<br>
	 But I'm carryin' all these thoughts and I just want to escape the pain<br>
	 I don't wanna hear from you, I'm losin' my temper now<br>
	 Get the fuck up off my phone, I don't wanna hear from ya<br>
	 Went to Pella for like 3 days<br>
	 Came back and now I still feel the same way<br>
	 Still stuck, in pain<br>
	 Like, why the fuck am I haunted by what went wrong, day by day?<br>
	 Like, why the fuck do I keep second-guessing shit I can't change?<br>
	 Like, why am I so obsessed? She wasn't even a good flame <br>
	 Shit don't make no sense<br>
	 I mean, it still feels intense<br>
	 I'm nineteen, tryna balance school, life and regret<br>
	 Friends say to move on, but somehow that makes me upset<br>
	 And my girl was always upset 'cause I'm always fuckin' workin'<br>
	 Shit, I expect some respect<br>
	 Can't talk to your friends without someone goin' for my neck<br>
	 Thought we'd work it all out . even with the distance and stress<br>
	 But now, i feel disconnected, tryna make sense of what's left<br>
	<br>
		Hold on, baby, check the score, why the hell you talkin' for?<br>
		How many weeks you go out? Then avoid me, like what for?, um<br>
		That's just one thing and plus your dryness, there's a couple more<br>
		I look around and think of how we had so much before<br>
		I See pics online, but I won't react, won't say a word<br>
		You want my reaction, but my time's some shit you don't deserve<br>
		Memories still flood my mind, wish they'd go unheard<br>
		I wake up and thank the Lord<br>
		Maybe this time, I need to close the door<br>
<br>
		Uh, I do not really give a fuck<br>
		Moving on feels so rough, I'm sorry<br>
		And I do not really give a fuck<br>
		But when i get lost in thought, I just get stuck, and I'm sorry<br>
