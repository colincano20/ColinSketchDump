    <h1>SORRY - Altered Lyrics</h1>
    <p>
	 Woke up with the sun today, it's another sunny day<br>
     I went past my mama crib, 90210, L.A.​​<br>
		Bought that shit six months ago, I'm set for life, yeah, some would say<br>
		But every day, I wake up scared that it could be taken from me<br>
		I'm not givin' nothin' back, I got used to gettin' paid<br>
		But no one ever told me what I'd have to sacrifice for fame<br>
		I'm just tryin' not to go insane<br>
		But I got all this weight on me and I just wanna run away<br>
		I don't wanna hear from you, I'm losin' my temper now<br>
		Get the fuck up off my phone, I don't wanna hear from ya<br>
		Went to Mexico for like six days<br>
		Camе back and now I still feel the same way<br>
		Fucked up, in pain<br>
		Likе, why the fuck I spent a hundred fifty on this plane?<br>
		Like, why the fuck I spent two hundred sixty on these chains?<br>
		Like, how am I so paranoid? I bulletproofed my Range<br>
		Shit don't make no sense<br>
		I mean, the pressure's immense<br>
		I'm nineteen, tryna navigate money and stress<br>
		Weird industry friends and my family life is intense<br>
		And my girl is always upset 'cause I'm always fuckin' workin'<br>
		Shit, I expect some respect<br>
		Can't even go on the 'net without someone goin' for my neck<br>
		I forget that I'm blessed, I pray to God, I hope it's a test<br>
		'Cause I've been givin' so much, I don't know what I got left<br>
		[Verse 2]<br>
		Hold on, baby, check the score, why the hell you talkin' for?<br>
		How many weeks on Billboard? Top ten, like forty-four, um<br>
		That's just one song and plus my albums, there's a couple more<br>
		Walked in Louis, bought the store, model bitch, she love couture<br>
		All that sneak dissin' on the internet, you must be bored<br>
		Want my reaction, but my time's some shit you can't afford<br>
		I paid like way too much for these diamonds, these bitches ain't floored<br>
		I wake up and thank the Lord<br>
		Brand-new drink, I sip and pour it up<br>

		[Chorus]<br>
		Uh, I do not really give a fuck<br>
		Maybach truck, I pulled it off and I'm sorry<br>
		And I do not really give a fuck<br>
		When I get high, I just get stuck and I'm sorry<br>

		[Outro]
		(I am, I am, I am)
		(I am, I am, I am)
		(Sorry, sorry)
		(Sorry)
        "I used to say it was fine,<br>
        But deep down, I know it’s a crime.<br>
        Now I’m standing here all alone,<br>
        Wondering if you'll ever pick up the phone."
