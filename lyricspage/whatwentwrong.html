    <h1>WHAT WENT WRONG??? - Altered Lyrics</h1>
    <p>

        I'ma take her back to back tryna fill the space<br>
        Off tequila, at the crib, still can't replace<br>
        There's a whole 'lot of women runnin' on my phone<br>
        But the whole time, yeah, the whole time, I can only think about you<br>
        <br>
        Still got memories, stuck in the rain, replayed days, now they're slippin'<br>
        I know it's cliché, life's rearranged, but you changed up, and now it's different<br>
        And I know we both said, "So long"<br>
        But I still can't find what went wrong<br>
        <br>
        Heart went cold, time turned short, I was in the dorm losing control<br>
        I was off the pills, I was in the zone, trippin' off shit that you was on<br>
        Looked me in my face, looked me in my eyes and you swore to God that you wasn't wrong<br>
        Fuck it, I'm good, I guess we're done, I cannot give no fucks no more<br>
        Two in the mornin', textin', "what's up?" I'm drunk as a bitch right now, I'm stuck<br>
        "Did I do too much?" You said, "Not enough," I need some closure, can you open up?<br>
        I'll pretend that I'm good without you, I'm tryna talk to somebody new<br>
        But it's gettin' hard to hold a conversation 'cause the whole time, all I'm thinkin' 'bout you<br>
        I don't know if I'm comin' off rude, I'm sorry, I'm just tellin' the truth<br>
        Brand new girl, it's cool, but everybody, I had to lose<br>
        Yet, it's you every time that I choose, who got in your head? And why you confused?<br>
        I don't want to hear it, jsut tell me the truth, you just wastin' time<br>
        <br>
        I'ma take her back to back tryna fill the space<br>
        Off tequila, at the crib, still can't replace<br>
        There's a whole 'lot of women runnin' on my phone<br>
        But the whole time, yeah, the whole time, I can only think about you<br>
        <br>
        Still got memories, stuck in the rain, replayed days, now they're slippin'<br>
        I know it's cliché, life's rearranged, but you changed up, and now it's different<br>
        And I know we both said, "So long"<br>
        But I still can't find what went wrong<br>
        <br>
        Who is he? What the fuck? I still don't really know what's up<br>
        Got a new bitch every week, I'm tryna replace your love, okay<br>
        Spent a week, pourin' up, It sucks I could ever be enough<br>
        Sippin' slow, keep my pain on the low , you had me really believin' in love<br>
        You said you saw a future, that we was serious, don't say sorry, I'm really not hearin' it<br>
        Off some shit and it's got me delirious, I fucked up too, that's point blank, period<br>
        Heard all that shit and I'm curious, all I do is just pray it ain't true<br>
        Yeah, I'd rather talk to you, but you just gon' waste my time<br>
        <br>
        I'ma take her back to back tryna fill the space<br>
        Off tequila, at the crib, still can't replace<br>
        There's a whole 'lot of women runnin' on my phone<br>
        But the whole time, yeah, the whole time, I can only think about you<br>
       <br>
        Still got memories, stuck in the rain, replayed days, now they're slippin'<br>
        I know it's cliché, life's rearranged, but you changed up, and now it's different<br>
        And I know we both said, "So long"<br>
        But I still can't find what went wrong<br>
