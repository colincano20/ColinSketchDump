    <h1>WHERE DO YOU SLEEP? - Altered Lyrics</h1>
    <p>
	    Out of respect, I'll keep you nameless<br>
		But everybody knows this 'bout you, I can't fake it<br>
		Heard you got a new man, if I see him, we fadin'<br>
		It's a shame that it went down the way it did, that's how the game is<br>
		Uh, you couldn't keep up to speed, I couldn't wait here<br>
		I wanna stay in and chill, you wanna get faded<br>
		I know the real you and not the one that you painted<br>
		You always said you that I changed up and you hate it<br>
		You hate that I don't trust you no more, hate that I'm leavin'<br>
		Uh, you don't believe in us, you hate that I'm believin'<br>
		You hate when I give you opinions on the decisions that you're makin'<br>
		You want someone agreein' with everything you're sayin'<br>
		We said forever, forever came quickly<br>
		8PM hit, are you at home, do you miss me?<br>
		Or are you at the bars, poppin' off with your friends?<br>
		I loved you so much that it turned to resentment<br>

		Where are you at? Where are you sleepin'?<br>
		Pickin' up the pieces, I'm just tryna get peace with it<br>
		Where are you at? Who do you sleep with?<br>
		Met him at the bar, are you tryna spend a week with him?<br>
       <br>
	    Trust me, I'm not tryna make it sound like I was perfect<br>
		I know there were things that I fucked up on, I was workin'<br>
		On it, but the way we ended, I don't think I deserved it<br>
		I hoped you were who I thought you were, and it wasn't on purpose<br>
		I hope that you know I loved you, but right now I'm hurtin'<br>
		Fightin' on the phone with each other, goin' nowhere<br>
		Can we talk about it in person?<br>
		I thought it gets better with time, this only worsened<br>
		<br>
		Ayy, forcin' myself to move on<br>
		I don't feel like myself since you been gone<br>
		It's been two weeks since you been M.I.A.​​<br>
		I changed the key to my phone, am I safe?<br>
		I would've did shit I would never do, but if you asked for it<br>
		For whatever that you need, I was goin' out sad for it<br>
		I never should've did none of that shit, I had a bad feelin'<br>
		If he don't do it right, just let me know and I'll be back, uh<br>
		Back, huh, yeah, I'll be back<br>
		Yeah, the last text that you sent to me had me stuck, uh<br>
		It's been two weeks, still don't know how to respond, ayy<br>
		Used to dream while you walkin' down the aisle, daddy on your arm, uh<br>
		And despite everything, I still kinda think that you're the one, uh<br>
		Or maybe that's just right now 'cause I'm alone and I'm drunk (I'm drunk)<br>
		When I got that call about ya, my heart sunk<br>
		Now whenever they talk about ya, I'm like, "What?<br>
		<br>
