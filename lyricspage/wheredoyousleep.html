    <h1>WHERE DO YOU SLEEP? - Altered Lyrics</h1>
    <p>
	    Out of respect, I'll keep you nameless<br>
		But everybody knows this 'bout you, I can't fake it<br>
		Heard you got a new man, if I see him, we fadin'<br>
		It's a shame that it went down the way it did, that's how the game is<br>
		Uh, you couldn't keep up to speed, I couldn't wait here<br>
		I wanna stay in and chill, you wanna get faded<br>
		I know the real you and not the one that you painted<br>
		You always said you that I changed up and you hate it<br>
		You hate that I don't trust you no more, hate that I'm leavin'<br>
		Uh, you don't believe in us, you hate that I'm believin'<br>
		You hate when I give you opinions on the decisions that you're makin'<br>
		You want someone agreein' with everything you're sayin'<br>
		We said forever, forever came quickly<br>
		8PM hit, are you at home, do you miss me?<br>
		Or are you at the bars, poppin' off with your friends?<br>
		I loved you so much that it turned to resentment<br>

		Where are you at? Where are you sleepin'?<br>
		Pickin' up the pieces, I'm just tryna get peace with it<br>
		Where are you at? Who do you sleep with?<br>
		Met him at the bar, are you tryna spend a week with him?<br>
